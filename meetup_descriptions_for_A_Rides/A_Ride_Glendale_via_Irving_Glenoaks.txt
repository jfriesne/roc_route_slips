â€¢ What we'll do
This is the Glendale ride with coffee at the Paradise Bakery. It is 41 miles and has only 900 feet of climbing. There is a bathroom break about 12 miles in at the rec center. Since this is a relatively short ride with not a lot of climbing the B riders will be combined with the A group.
