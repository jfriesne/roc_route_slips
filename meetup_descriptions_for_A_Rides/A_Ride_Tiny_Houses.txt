This ride which takes us West into Glendale via a convoluted route. For the A riders it is 53 miles and 2700 feet of climbing. For the B riders, 39 miles and 2070 feet of climbing.  B riders start at Victory Park on Paloma and join the A Ride as it goes by. We have done this ride before and enjoyed it.

NOTE: no idea where the tiny houses are....
