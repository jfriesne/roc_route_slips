NOTE: It's not clear if the road to Cogswell Dam is open. I suggest we ride up to the turnoff and make a decision at that point. Worse case is we keep riding up 39 for another 5-8 miles.

This ride goes up Hwy 39 passed East Fork and then takes a service road up to Cogswell dam. Please download the route map: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfriesne/roc_route_slips/master/A_Ride_Cogswell_Dam.txt
