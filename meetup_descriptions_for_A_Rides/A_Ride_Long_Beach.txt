This ride is Gary's Long Beach ride, which is a straight shot down the Rio Hondo bike path to Long Beach, and then back.

I've modified the ride to stop at Panera in South Gate, instead of Tom's Burgers, since I think our group is more coffee-oriented than burger-oriented.  However, if we want we can stop somewhere in Long Beach instead.

Route slip is here ( https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfriesne/roc_route_slips/master/A_Ride_Long_Beach.txt ), route map is here ( https://www.mapmyride.com/routes/view/6126567379/ ).  The ride is about 65 miles long, but if you want to make it shorter you can arrange to meet us along the way (e.g. at the Santa Anita Ave overpass over the bike path, or even somewhere south of that along the bike path)
