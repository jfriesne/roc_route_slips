This is the ride to Long Beach. The ride goes along the Rio Hondo bike path to Ansen Ford Park, and from there south to Long Beach. The ride starts at Vons in Monrovia but riders can chose to start from Peck Park. "B" riders can turn around at Ansen Ford Park which makes it about a 38 mile round trip. Starting from Peck Park reduces the mileage by about 9 miles. For the shorter riders coffee is in Pico Rivera at our usual Starbucks.

This ride is flat but relatively long (66 miles).
