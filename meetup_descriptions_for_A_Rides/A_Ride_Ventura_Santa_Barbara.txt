Ride from Ventura to Summerland / Santa Barbara and back to Ventura. This will be approximately a 44/50 mile ride with 1216 feet of climbing. For the Summerland riders Coffee/Breakfast/Lunch is at Summerland Beach Cafe but this can be changed if someone has a better choice. For those riders heading to Santa Barbara coffee/lunch TBD.

Ride will leave Ventura at 9 am so plan to get there a little early. The meeting point is the West Main Street Parking lot (Main Street and Peking Street). Use this address for GPS - 239 W. Main St. Ventura. This is the Ventura Bike Depot and the parking lot is just ahead on the left. If there is no parking available in the lot there is plenty of parking on the side streets.

If you are attending this event please make sure I have your phone number so you can be contacted it running late or need assistance. Send me, Neil Brans, your phone number via ROC contact email.
