This is a new ride courtesy of Jeremy and the Foothill club. We are going west and it is 38 miles with 1350 feet of climbing. Coffee is at the Union Bakery in South Pasadena. People rave about their muffins. One of the fun points is going over the overpass in Montebello. Just be careful and give the person ahead of you plenty of space. Some people end up walking their bikes up the ramp. Print out the route map and enjoy the ride.
