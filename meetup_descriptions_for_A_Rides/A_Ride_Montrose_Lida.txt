This week's SATURDAY A and B RIDE is the MONTROSE VIA LIDA RIDE which is 36 miles long and has only about 2,000 ft. of elevation gain some of which is just a bit more than moderate climbing. For those that want to avoid the Lida climb, continue on Linda Vista to Highland and then stay on Highland until you reach Chevy Chase. Turn right and you are back on the main route (see B route below).

Please download the route slip from this link (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfriesne/roc_route_slips/master/A_Ride_Montrose_Lida.txt), print it out, and keep it with you during the ride.
