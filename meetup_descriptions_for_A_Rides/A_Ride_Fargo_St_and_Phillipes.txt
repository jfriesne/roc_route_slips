This ride takes us through Eagle Rock and Glassel Park, then down through
the Silver Lake area past Fargo Street, the steepest street in Los Angeles
with a 33 percent grade!  (You can try to climb it if you want to, but you
don't have to!)

Then we stop for lunch at Phillipe downtown, before returning through
Lincoln Heights and San Marino.
