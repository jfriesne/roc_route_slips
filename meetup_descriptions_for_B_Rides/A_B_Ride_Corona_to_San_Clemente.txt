Join us on a wild ride from Corona or Anaheim to San Clemente. We take the beautiful Santa Ana trail down to the ocean and then continue along the ocean front to San Clemente. Lots of rest breaks along the way. B riders can start in Anaheim and join us on the bike trail by Katella Ave. The A ride is 63.5 miles and the B ride is 43 miles. Once in San Clemente we take the Metro link back. We will have lunch at the peer in San Clemente as we await the train. Which train to take back depends on how late we arrive at the peer and whether people want to have lunch there.

San Clemente to Corona Metro link 2.59 and 4:52
San Clemente to Anaheim Metro link 1:52 and 6:00

Option for those starting in Anaheim they can take the train to Corona and be driven back to their cars.
