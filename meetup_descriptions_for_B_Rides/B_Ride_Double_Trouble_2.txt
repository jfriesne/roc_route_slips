
This is the B ride version of Double Trouble 2. A 34.76 mile ride with 1952 feet of elevation gain. The A and B routes keep together until Descanso were the B group heads for coffee and A riders do more climbing and then hopefully join the B group for coffee. The return route is different.

Please download the route slip from this link (https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jfriesne/roc_route_slips/master/B_Ride_Double_Trouble_2.txt), print it out, and keep it with you during the ride.
